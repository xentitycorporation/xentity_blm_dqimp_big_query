    "The concept of the Case Group is one that has had ambiguity in the past, and is further exacerbated by the recent migration of LR2000 and the associated merging of the (now deprecated) ALIS system.

Case Groups have been 'solved' by different users for different needs, and there are a resulting 3 known places to see these attempts.
