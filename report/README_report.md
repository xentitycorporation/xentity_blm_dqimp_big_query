# BLM SETA Data Quality Testing Report Workspace
This README describes purpose of the monthly report and houses the monthly report template.
---

## Report Template 
The template consists of 'rolling numbers' of five month increments each week.

## KPI Reports 
As key topics are identified, secondary reports will be created to track these important high value tests that are not part of the monthly report. This will also keep the monthly report from becoming too large in size.
